// said-vs-done — one judgement of "was there anything to read at all",
//
// TAKEN FROM odd-one-out, not rewritten. The two tools share this layer
// verbatim on purpose: a second implementation of it would be a second place
// to fix, and the difference between the tools is in what they MEASURE, not
// in how they read a flag or write a run to disk.
// shared by every detector.
//
// WHY. `deps` and `sql` had an explicit TOO LITTLE DATA state; `java` — the
// detector everyone reaches for first — had none at all. On a three-file
// project it printed `rules=0` and nothing else, indistinguishable from "your
// code is consistent". That is the worst possible first contact: the reader
// cannot tell whether the tool found nothing or had nothing to look at.
//
// ONE PLACE, NOT A THIRD COPY. The decision and the message live here; each
// detector only supplies its own count and its own threshold.
//
// THE THRESHOLD STAYS PER DETECTOR, and that is deliberate. It is tempting to
// unify the number as well, but these thresholds are load-bearing rather than
// cosmetic: `java` uses minsup 3, and the known answer
// `MediaPlayer#dispose -> setOnError` has support of exactly 3 — raising the
// threshold to 5 would delete it (measured). What is unified is the JUDGEMENT
// and the MESSAGE, not the value.
