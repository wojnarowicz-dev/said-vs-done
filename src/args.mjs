// said-vs-done — command-line argument reading, one implementation.
//
// TAKEN FROM odd-one-out, not rewritten. The two tools share this layer
// verbatim on purpose: a second implementation of it would be a second place
// to fix, and the difference between the tools is in what they MEASURE, not
// in how they read a flag or write a run to disk.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Four detectors carried their own copy of the same
// `argv.indexOf` helper, and three more modules (config, lang, snapshot) read
// their own flag inline. Nine files reached into `process.argv` on their own.
// That is precisely the class of defect this tool is meant to find — and the one
// it could not see in itself, because `deps` measures bypassing an EXISTING
// layer and there was no layer to bypass.
//
// This module has NO IMPORTS on purpose: `lang.mjs` needs it to read `--lang`,
// so anything it imported would risk a cycle.
//
// THE BEHAVIOUR IS DELIBERATELY BYTE-FOR-BYTE THE OLD ONE, including the parts
// that look odd:
//   * a flag with no value yields `true`, not an empty string — that is what
//     `--filter`, `--stability` and `--all` rely on;
//   * a value beginning with `--` is treated as ABSENT, so `--only --top 5`
//     reads as "--only with no value" rather than swallowing the next flag.
// Changing either would silently alter how several switches behave, and no
// count in any report would move.
