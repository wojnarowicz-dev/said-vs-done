// TAKEN FROM odd-one-out, not rewritten. The two tools share this layer
// verbatim on purpose: a second implementation of it would be a second place
// to fix, and the difference between the tools is in what they MEASURE, not
// in how they read a flag or write a run to disk.
//
// WHY. Without this, every run makes you read the same findings from scratch
// and you cannot see what was added. The question is not "what is wrong" but
// "what is wrong SINCE LAST TIME".
//
// THE FINGERPRINT CONTAINS NO LINE NUMBER. That is the one decision here that
// really matters. Line numbers shift on every unrelated edit of a file — if
// they entered the fingerprint, adding an import at the top of a file would
// wipe out every old finding and re-issue them as NEW. The fingerprint rests on
// semantic identity: detector + rule + file + anchor (receiver, function name,
// artefact coordinates). The line number travels alongside, as information.
//
// FILE PATH ≠ IMMUTABLE FINGERPRINT. Moving a class to another package changes
// the path, and the finding shows up as NEW + GONE. That is a deliberate
// trade-off: the alternative is a fingerprint without the path, under which two
// different sites sharing an anchor merge into one.
